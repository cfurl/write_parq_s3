simple build and run

 docker image build --tag chuckie-please .  (note the dot indicates to build Dockerfile in current folder)
 
 docker container run chuckie-please
 
to solve my AWS permissions issues I just copied the .Renviron file to the container home folder.  Just like I would in a non-docker env... 
I have the .Renviron on the gitignore
